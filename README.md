# Rubiks-Cube by Rohan Nair and Siddharth Tickle

**NOTE: YOU MUST INSTALL THE PROCESSING IDE IN ORDER TO DEVELOP AND RUN THIS PROGRAM**

This program emulates a Rubik's Cube in a 3-Dimensional environment using the Processing API for Java(no we did not copy from coding train)

Upon starting this program, the cube will start off in a solved state and the front, right, left, back, up, and down sides are all mapped
to Orange, Green, Blue, Red, White, and Yellow sides respectively.

You can rotate front, right, left, back, up, and down sides clockwise by pressing the f, r, l, b, and u keys respectively and likewise
rotate them counterclockwise by holding down the shift key while pressing all of the keys.

Additionally, you can continuously press the s key to undo the previous move you made and eventually solve it.

On the contrary, you can press the k key to randomize the entire cube.

*NOTE: we are still working on this project as we plan to add an algorithm recognition method that allows the program to tell the user
what algorithm to input when solving the cube and much more. Feel free to leave any additional suggestions or bugs you may find in the issues tab or make your own branch and see how you can make our program better!
